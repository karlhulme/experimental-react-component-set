  This is the root that will be used to render the content for the UI components.
  It is referenced above to provide a wrapper so we can check
  that components are not supplying any additional margin/padding.
  The .surfaces-paper class is used by the main application CSS to set the initial
  font family, font size, background-color, text color and anti-aliasing values.
